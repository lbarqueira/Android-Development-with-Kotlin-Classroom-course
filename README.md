# [Android Development with Kotlin: Classroom course](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-development-with-kotlin/course)

This course is designed for students taking instructor-led Android curriculum in a classroom setting as part of the Android Development with Kotlin program.

## [Unit 1: Get started with Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-development-with-kotlin/unit-1)

Take your first steps programming in Kotlin.


### [Lesson 1: Kotlin basics](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-development-with-kotlin-1)

Get started developing in Kotlin, and learn the basics of the Kotlin programming language: data types, operators, variables, control structures, and nullable versus non-nullable variables.

[Summary](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-development-kotlin-1.2?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcourses%2Fpathways%2Fandroid-development-with-kotlin-1%3Fhl%3Den%23codelab-https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.android.com%2Fcodelabs%2Fandroid-development-kotlin-1.2&hl=en#5)

Kotlin is very similar to other languages when it comes to the basics like operators, lists, and loops, but there are some important differences.
The following features may be different in Kotlin than what you're used to in other languages:
- Kotlin types can't be implicitly converted—use casting.
- Variables declared with ```val``` can only be assigned once.
- Kotlin variables are not nullable by default. Use ```?``` to make variables nullable.
- With Kotlin, you can loop through the index and elements of an array at the same time in a for loop.

The following Kotlin programming constructs are similar to those in other languages:
- Arrays and lists can have a single type or mixed types.
- Arrays and lists can be nested.
- You can create loops with ```for```, ```while```, ```do/while```, and ```repeat```.
- The ```when``` statement is Kotlin's version of the switch statement, but when is more flexible.

### [Lesson 2: Functions](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-development-with-kotlin-2)

Create a Kotlin program and learn about functions in Kotlin, including default values for parameters, filters, lambdas, and compact functions.

### [Lesson 3: Classes and Objects](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-development-with-kotlin-3)

Learn about classes, objects, and inheritance in Kotlin. Create small programs as you learn about abstract classes, interfaces, and interface delegation.

### For instructors teaching a course

The Android Development with Kotlin course teaches the fundamentals of Android app development with the Kotlin programming language. These materials are designed for instructors to deliver lectures in a classroom setting. The course is 13 lessons long with each lecture being approximately 1 hour long. Each lecture is accompanied by 2 hours of hands-on codelabs for the students to complete on their own. If you’re ready to start teaching Android, use these materials to get started today.
